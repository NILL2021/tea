### Un-named game in godot  _13/02/22_
I have begun development on an unnamed game in godot.
Its designed to make you rage because of the rigid movement handled by this code:

```gdscript
apply_central_impulse(-get_global_mouse_position()/30)
```
You have to get through certain levels by shooting a shotgun to propel you into the air.
